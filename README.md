Greetings everyone. This project is one which would help the curious understand the basics of python.
I believe that you have come here from my linkdin post as the chances otherwise are miniscule.
Please have an open mind and comment on my linkdin post if you have any issues with any part of this code.
I coded using Jupyter Notebook on anaconda 64bits. I highly recommend this software for python.
I shifted to VS Code recently but I still use the environment variables of Jupyter Notebook. 
Lastly, I hope you all enjoy this silly project of mine. 
Thank You.
